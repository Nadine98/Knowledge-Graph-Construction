# Knowledge Graph Construction 
This is a software implementation for the project 'Knowledge Graph Construction'. The project’s goal is to build a Knowledge Graph (KG) about food products sold on Amazon. For the construction, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) will be used. 

## Installation
The program can be executed by cloning this git-repository and running the **builddKG.py** program. This program can be executed in the command line or in a development environment (IDE) that supports a Python Interpreter like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

>**Note: This project's implementation uses the latest version of Python (Python 3.10) and it was only tested on the operation system Windows. The program’s execution could lead to problems on Linux or macOS systems because of the pathname conventions. In addition, you have to ensure that you installed all imported libraries as well as the Chrome Web-Driver on your system**
